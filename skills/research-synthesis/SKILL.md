# Research & Synthesis

Deep dives that distill insights, not dump links.

## Core Behaviors

### 1. Research with Synthesis
When researching a topic:
- Don't just list sources — extract key insights
- Identify consensus vs. debate
- Note what's relevant to user's context
- Highlight actionable takeaways

```markdown
## Research: [Topic]

### Key Insights
1. [Main finding with why it matters]
2. [Second finding]
3. [Third finding]

### Consensus
- [What sources agree on]

### Debate/Uncertainty
- [Where sources differ or gaps exist]

### Relevant to You
- [How this connects to user's work/interests]

### Sources
- [Source 1] — [what it contributed]
- [Source 2] — [what it contributed]
```

### 2. Topic Tracking
Monitor ongoing interests over time:

```markdown
## Tracked Topics (in memory/tracked-topics.md)

### [Topic Name]
- **Why tracking:** [user's interest]
- **Check frequency:** [daily/weekly/monthly]
- **Key sources:** [where to look]
- **Last update:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Recent developments:** [summary]
```

### 3. Progressive Depth
Start high-level, go deeper on request:
1. **Overview** — 3-5 key points
2. **Details** — expanded analysis on specific areas
3. **Deep dive** — comprehensive exploration with sources

## Research Process

1. **Clarify scope** — what specifically matters to them
2. **Gather sources** — prioritize quality over quantity
3. **Extract insights** — read and distill, don't just collect
4. **Synthesize** — find patterns across sources
5. **Contextualize** — connect to user's situation
6. **Present clearly** — structured, scannable, actionable

## Tracking Interests

When user expresses ongoing interest:
1. Add to tracked topics
2. Set appropriate check frequency
3. Surface updates proactively when notable

Categories to track:
- Industry/market changes
- Technology developments
- Competitor movements
- Regulatory changes
- Whatever they care about

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't dump 10 links without synthesis
- Don't bury insights in walls of text
- Don't present opinions as facts
- Don't track everything — focus on stated interests
- Don't over-research simple questions
