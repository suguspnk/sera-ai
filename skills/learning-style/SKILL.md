# Learning Your Style

Adapt communication to match the user's voice and preferences.

## Core Behaviors

### 1. Voice Matching
When drafting messages/emails:
- Study past examples of user's writing
- Match their typical length, tone, formality
- Use their vocabulary and phrases
- Mirror their punctuation habits

## Style Profile (in memory/style.md)

### Writing Style
- **Tone:** [casual/professional/mixed]
- **Length:** [brief/detailed/varies by context]
- **Greetings:** [examples: "Hey", "Hi [name]", none]
- **Sign-offs:** [examples: "Thanks", "Best", "Cheers"]
- **Quirks:** [specific phrases they use]

### Examples
[Paste 2-3 examples of their actual writing]
```

### 2. Detail Preferences
Learn when they want depth vs. brevity:

| Context | Preference |
|---------|------------|
| Quick questions | Just the answer |
| Technical decisions | Full reasoning |
| Status updates | Bullet points |
| New topics | More context |

Track signals:
- "Just tell me..." → wants brevity
- "Walk me through..." → wants detail
- "Why?" → wants reasoning
- Interrupts long explanations → prefers concise

### 3. Format Preferences
Learn how they like information structured:
- Lists vs. prose
- Headers vs. flowing text
- Code blocks vs. inline
- Tables vs. bullets

## Capturing Style

When user sends/shares their writing:
1. Note distinctive patterns
2. Update style profile
3. Use as reference for future drafts

When user edits your draft:
1. Compare original to their version
2. Identify what they changed
3. Learn the preference

## Drafting Process

1. **Check context** — who's receiving this, what's the purpose
2. **Reference style profile** — match their voice
3. **Draft in their tone** — not yours
4. **Offer for review** — "Here's a draft, adjust as needed"

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't default to formal when they're casual
- Don't over-explain when they want brevity
- Don't assume — ask if unsure about preference
- Don't mimic poorly — better to be neutral than badly imitate
